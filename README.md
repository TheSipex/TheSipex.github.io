# Sipex Team

SipexTeam was a development team made by me and another friend. We started it back in October of 2017. It died a few days later after an argument (at least from memory, it was an argument).

I was working on my Facebook page for my employers to see when wanting to hire me, when i decided to look at all my old and cringy Facebook pages I made as a kid. As i was scrolling, one caught my eye, the Sipex one. Today (September 6th 2021), was the day i remember of Sipex, a development team that was forgotten about almost 4 years ago.

I decided to buy a domain name for Sipex (Sipex.me, free with my GitHub Student, so not really bought, but i'm broke), in memory of Sipex. Which is why I am making this Document, for the memory of Sipex.

Sipex may have ended up a failure, but i ended up making a company 3 years later, named ZechTech LLC. This is not about advertising my company though, so I will leave it at that.

Reason I decided to make this was to show my friend, whose idea it was to start Sipex, Lunix ([GitHub](https://github.com/daddylunix "GitHub")), how much i appreciate him as a friend. Thank you Lunix for everything you have done for me, wouldn't be where I am without you buddy!

And this will be the end of the Document. Thank you to the very few people who will read this. Also Thank you Lunix, for the wonderful memories the past 4-5 years i've known you!

Maybe one day, Sipex will become a reality, but until then may Sipex rest in peace.

Signing off!
